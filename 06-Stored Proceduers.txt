1. Stored procedure is precomplied and executed only whenever it is called but stored function is complied and executed everytime it is called
2. We can use transactions in stored procudure but can't use in stored function
3. Stored function must return a value but in a stored procedure it is optional
4. Stored function can be called from stored procedure but vice versa is not possible 
5. DML(Insert/Update/Delete) operations are not possible in stored function, it only allows SELECT statememnt in it
6. We can use function in SELECT, WHERE, HAVING clause and even with Joins which is not possible with stored procedure
