What is SQL?
- SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard language used to interact with relational databasesâ€”performing operations like querying, updating, and managing data

Types of SQL commands
- DDL (Data Definition Language): CREATE, ALTER, DROP
  DML (Data Manipulation Language): SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
  DCL (Data Control Language): GRANT, REVOKE
  TCL (Transaction Control Language): COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT
  DQL (Data Query Language): SELECT

Difference between DELETE, TRUNCATE and DROP
- DELETE: Removes rows, can have a WHERE clause and is rollback-able
  TRUNCATE: Deletes all rows in a table, faster than DELETE, cannot be rolled back
  DROP: Removes the table structure from the database completely

Primary Key? Foreign Key?
- Primary Key: Uniquely identifies each row in a table; cannot be NULL or duplicated.
  Foreign Key: Creates a link between two tables, referencing the primary key of another table to maintain referential integrity

Different types of JOIN
- INNER JOIN: Retrieves records with matching values in both tables
  LEFT JOIN: All records from the left table and matched records from the right table
  RIGHT JOIN: All records from the right table and matched records from the left
  FULL JOIN: All records from both tables including unmatched rows

What is a view? How is it different from a table?
- A view is a virtual table based on SQL queries used to simplify data access and enhance security. Unlike tables views do not store data themselves.



Sample Questions:
1. Retrieve duplicate records from a table
- SELECT ColumnName, COUNT(*) FROM Employees GROUP BY ColumnName HAVING COUNT(*) > 1

2. Find the second highest salary from an Employee table
- SELECT EmpName, EmpSalary, DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY EmpSalary DESC) AS Ranks FROM Employee
