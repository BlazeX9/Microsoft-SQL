Simple View ->- When view is created on a single table, Supports all DML Operations.
	
CREATE VIEW simple AS
SELECT * FROM employee;
	
SELECT * FROM simple;

Complex View ->- When view is create on multiple tables, does not supports all DML operations.

CREATE VIEW complex_noindex AS
SELECT a.empid,a.empname,b.empsalary,b.empcity
FROM emp_details a JOIN emp_salary b ON a.empid=b.empid;
	
SELECT * FROM complex_noindex;


Normal view creates a virtual table and gives no performance benifits, while executing complex queries data fetching takes long time.
Materialized view sotres the data physically and gives performance benifits as data is precompiled, while executing complex queries data fetching is faster.

CREATE VIEW MyView
WITH SCHEMABINDING AS
SELECT a.empid,a.empname,b.empsalary,b.empcity
FROM dbo.emp_details a JOIN dbo.emp_salary b ON a.empid=b.empid;
	
CREATE UNIQUE CLUSTERED INDEX MyIndex ON MyView(a.empid);
SELECT * FROM MyIndex;
	
	
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX MyIndex ON complex_index(a.empname);
SELECT * FROM MyIndex WITH(NOEXPAND)
